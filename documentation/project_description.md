# Project description

The purpose of this project is to investigate how the Huffman algorithm works and performs as a lossless compression algorithm. This project is coded using Java.

I chose this topic because compressing data has so many practical applications. For example in a digital marketplace, when a user downloads an image of some item s/he is planning to sell, the system often needs to compress the image to a smaller size.

The documentation, code and comments are written in English. This project is a part of my degree "tietojenkäsittelytieteen kandidaatti (TKT)".

## Algorithms and data structures
The Huffman algorithm is  implemented without Java’s own data structures. Hence, all the necessary data structures will be coded (for example a priority queue).

## Time complexity
The time complexity for Huffman is O(n log n) (see references 1 and 2).

## Input and output
At least 10 different text files will be used as input to see how much space the compression saves. The aim is that each output file will be around 40-60% smaller compared with the input file.
