# Weekly report 2

### Tuesday 3.11.
I read and made notes about binary trees, heaps and priority queues so that I would understand how the Huffman algorithm really works. I resolved an issue with maven configurations. Started writing code to implement the Huffman algorithm.

### Thursday 5.11.
I continued programming, clarified class structures, and tried to make methods easier to test by assigning methods with parameters rather than using attributes. 

### Friday 6.11.
I created configurations for checkstyle, JavaDoc and jacoco.

Hours used this week: 16h.

Next I will clarify my existing methods so that I have a functioning program. I will also make JUnit tests. Then I will start thinking about how to use text files as input.

Right now it is unclear to me if I also need to implement the decompression.
