# Weekly report 3

On Tuesday 10.11.2020 I refactored code in class Input, and wrote tests for the class.

On Thursday 12.11.2020 I continued work on class Input, and started refactoring and writing tests for class HuffmanTree. HuffmanTree class very near ready. I wrote more JavaCode documentation.

I think it was nice to write the tests, and I realized it would have been better to start writing them earlier. Basically I refactored my code by first writing the tests for the unfinished methods, and then with the help of the test results was able to get them working. Lesson learned: write tests in the earliest possible phase.

Next I will finalize one method for class HuffmanTree and make a test for it (or the other way around), and move on to planning using real input and start implementing my own data structures. I have already got myself a textbook of data structures in Java.

Hours this week: 16
