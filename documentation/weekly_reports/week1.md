# Weekly report no 1

The biggest challenge for the first week was to choose the topic, and most of the time went to that. I learned about the Huffman and LZ77 algorithms on a general level, but I definitely want to do more reading before starting to code. 

At this point many things are still unclear. For example, what kind of and how many input files are needed to make a good comparison. 

Next I am going to read more about Huffman and LZ77, and about the data structures that are used in typical implementations. After this I am going to proceed to coding.

Hours spent with the project during this week: 5.
