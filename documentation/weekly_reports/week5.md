# Weekly report no 5

On Tuesday I continued with my own ArrayList (class MyList) by watching old TiRa lectures and reading old course material. I was overall unsure how to proceed because my project structure was not very clear. 

On Thursday I decided to continue with creating my own PriorityQueue implementation because I knew that I would need it in every case. I also received the peer review for my project and that was extremely helpful. On Friday I did the peer review for the project assigned to me ([link](https://github.com/HegePI/tiralabra-p2-compression-algorithms/issues/7) to the peer review). 

One thing I learned this week is that reliable textbooks are better sources than various websites on data structures. Now my to do -list looks like this: finish the own PriorityQueue implementation, start working on saving Huffman code as bits, make some instructions for use and/or clarify how the program works, implement the decompression part, and clarify the Input class. Also performance testing will be relevant when saving the Huffman code as bits works.

Hours this week: 15h.
