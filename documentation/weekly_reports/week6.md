# Report for week 6

This week I wrote class MyMinHeap, did tests for it and replaced Java's PriorityQueue with it in class HuffmanTree. I studied bit operations in Java and created a class that can handle writing a String version of the coded input to a file as bytes. I did refactoring in classes Main (which is basically the user interface), Output and Input. 

I realized that I have to make changes to class Input if I want to support also other than ASCII characters smoothly. I made a test with 2 different files on how the compression is performing. I made preliminary user instructions and started reading about how to implement the decompression part. Made code review nro 2. 

Hours used: 22h
